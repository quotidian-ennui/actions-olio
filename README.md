# actions-olio

It's a gallimaufry of actions; it might even have been a melange.

Basically this is just a repo where I can actions that I share between my personal repositories. Feel free to use them, fork it, whatever. This is for scratching my own itches. If it's useful for you then great.

- I may (or may not) tag & release them
- `@v1`, `@v1.1` style major/minor moveable tags are not supported; use explicit versions or hashes.
  - I _want you to read my meticulously crafted release notes_ rather than just consuming them because your actions have `@v1` on them.
