# pr-or-issue-comment

Updates an existing comment or creates a new comment on an issue/pull request.

## Why

Sometimes, the activity from a github action is pretty mysterious. It's nice to be able to leave a comment on the issue or pull request that triggered the action.

## Usage

- Requires you to have `issues:write` & `pull_requests:write` permissions attached to the token (depending on what you're doing).

```action
- name: comment
  id: comment
  uses: quotdian-ennui/actions-olio/pr-or-issue-comment@main
  if: success() || failure()
  with:
    issue_number: ${{ steps.findpr.outputs.pr }}
    body: |
      Overall workflow status : ${{ steps.whatever.outcome }}
      Check out the [workflow run](https://github.com/${{ github.repository }}/actions/runs/${{ github.run_id }}) for more details.
    token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    search_term: "unique-search-term"
    edit_mode: (replace) | append
```

## Notes

- `search_term` is essentially embedded into the comment wrapped by a XML comment tag. This defaults to some combination of `github.workflow` & `github.job` which may be unique enough provided you only have a single commment action in that particular workflow/job combination.
- `edit_mode` is as per peter-evans/create-or-update-comment. It defaults to _replace_ in this composite action.

## Dependencies

It's a composite action that wraps the following actions:

- peter-evans/find-comment
- peter-evans/create-or-update-comment
